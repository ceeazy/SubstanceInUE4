# Substance in UE4

All rights belong to [Allegorithmic](https://www.substance3d.com/)! This repository exists because by default, Code Plugins are only available to launcher-installed versions of Unreal Engine 4. Teams and individuals that work with UE4 compiled from source have to install a "dummy" version of UE4 through the launcher on their disk just to install those - with this repo I'm trying to get rid of this caveat for the [Substance in Unreal Engine plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/substance-plugin) by [Allegorithmic](https://www.substance3d.com/). 

## Installation

Select your desired engine version branch & download/pull to your desired engine or project's Plugins folder. For further info, please see the official [UE4 docs](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Plugins/index.html#pluginfolders).

### Enjoy!
